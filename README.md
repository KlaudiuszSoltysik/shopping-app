# Auction/shopping application
As of October 8, 2022, I am suspending the project in connection with the beginning of a new semester of studies. It is largely completed with a few fixes and improvements.
## Video demonstration: 
## Application features:
-Firebase authentication   
-register and login using email address and password  
-login with google account  
-password reset  
-the user can add an item advertisement with photos  
-the photos are stored in the Firestore, the rest of the advertisement along with the link to the photo from the cloud are stored in the Firebase  
-due to the free Firebase service package, photos take a long time to load, some of them are cashed  
-all items page with item cards, search, add item, account and log-out buttons  
-product page with carousel with photos and message button  
-account page with all users items for sale and delete button  
## To do:
-let user delete photos at add item stage  
-improve searching (no case sensitivity, no entire title requirements)  
-sending photos in private message  
-buy now button  
-notifications  
-make messages private
